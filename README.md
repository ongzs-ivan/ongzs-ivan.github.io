# What is this?
This is the repository of [my personal Github Page][1], which I use to summarize and showcase my experience as a game developer-cum-programmer.

# Who is this repository for?
Well, this is honestly just for myself.
If you're someone who's looking to work with me, I recommend checking out the page that this repo is built on <https://ongzs-ivan.github.io/>.
Otherwise, if you're looking for references on how to make your own Github site, feel free to look through.
But I would recommend directly referring to the creator of this template I used at [Feeling Responsive][2] as they have proper documentation on how to setup and use it.

# Who am I?
I'm Ivan Ong Zhisien.
*Game Developer*
*Programmer*
***Gundam Enthusiast***

But honestly, you're better off just looking at my website for more information.
It's much more presentable there.

## Did I make this website all by myself?
After familiarizing myself with setting up my own website using Github Pages (Which relies on Jekyll), I used the [Phlow's](https://github.com/Phlow/) [Feeling Responsive](https://phlow.github.io/feeling-responsive/) as my base template and remodelled its appearance to what I liked.

My name is Ivan Ong Zhisien. I'm a video game developer with 3+ years of experience in a professional environment.
I specialize as a programmeer, with significant experience in both Unity Engine and Unreal Engine (and abit in Godot).
Both my interests and specialty lie in Debugging and Network Programming.

<br><br>
I've worked on a couple of reputable titles under my current company, '<b>Double Eleven</b>', such as '<b>Minecraft Dungeons</b>', '<b>Prison Architect 2</b>' and '<b>Rust: Console Edition</b>'.

<br><br>
While I don't often participate in game jams as much as I used to, I am working on some personal projects (and am currently experimenting with the potential of Godot Engine) at the moment.

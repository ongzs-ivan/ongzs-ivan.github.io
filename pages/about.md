<p>
My name is Ivan Ong Zhisien. I'm a video game developer with 3+ years of experience in a professional environment.
As a game programmer, I have significant experience using Unity and Unreal Engine (and abit of Godot).
I am well versed in Debugging, Networking and Gameplay programming.
</p>

<p>
Under my current company, <a href = "https://double11.com/"><b>Double Eleven</b></a>, I gained significant experience in porting games from PC to consoles where I worked on reputable titles such as <a href = "https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/about-dungeons"><b>Minecraft Dungeons</b></a>, <a href = "https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/games/prison-architect-2/about"><b>Prison Architect 2</b></a> and <a href = "https://rust.double11.com/"><b>Rust: Console Edition</b></a>.
</p>

<p>
Outside of programming, I have some experience in game design and I hope to create my own series of mecha-themed games in the future.
